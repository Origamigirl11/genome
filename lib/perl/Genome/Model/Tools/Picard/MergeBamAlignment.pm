BestEndMapq is appropriate for cases in which the aligner is not pair-aware, and does not output the HI tag. It simply picks the alignment for each end with the highest MAPQ, and makes those alignments primary, regardless of whether the two alignments make sense together.MostDistant is also for a non-pair-aware aligner, and picks the alignment pair with the largest insert size. If all alignments would be chimeric, it picks the alignments for each end with the best MAPQ. For all algorithms, ties are resolved arbitrarily. Default value: BestMapq.',

     Merges alignment data from a SAM or BAM file with additional data stored in an unmapped BAM file and produces a third SAM or BAM file of aligned and unaligned reads. NOTE that this program expects to find a sequence dictionary in the same directory as REFERENCE_SEQUENCE and expects it to have the same base name as the reference fasta except with the extension '.dict'
